# K-Nearest Neighbours Project

Working with KNN Models is fun, especially for me, to build recommendation algorithms. It's a good way to put the machine to work, and surprisingly finding unexpected recommendations. Of course mouth to mouth recommendations are another level, but with proper features and models it can be very very good. 
For this project I used a dataset from IMDB to create a movie recommendator.

The idea of this project was to find similar recommendations through Cosine_Similarity. For such kind of problem, there's a strong need to prepare and clean your data very well so that the algorithm is able to properly identify and match similar words. The applications of this algorithm are vast, and can be easily turned into apps for e-commerce, services, streaming, etc...
